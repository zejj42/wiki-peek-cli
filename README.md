# Wiki Peek CLI

## Description

This script provides a command-line interface to fetch and display summaries from Wikipedia. It allows users to search for topics and choose from a list of relevant articles to display a concise summary.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   `git clone https://github.com/zejj42/wiki-peek-cli.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   `cd wiki-peek-cli`
3. Install the required dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Building the Executable

To use the script as a command-line utility, build it into an executable and add it to your system's PATH.

### On Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS):

1. Build the executable using PyInstaller:
   `pyinstaller --onefile --name wiki main.py`
2. Move the executable to `/usr/local/bin`:
   `sudo mv dist/wiki /usr/local/bin/wiki`
3. Ensure the executable is in your PATH:
   `wiki --version` or `wiki -h`

### On Windows:

1. Build the executable using PyInstaller:
   `pyinstaller --onefile --name wiki main.py`
2. Add the directory containing the `wiki.exe` to your PATH using the System Environment Variables settings.
3. Ensure the executable is in your PATH:
   `wiki --version` or `wiki -h`

## Usage

After building and moving the executable to your PATH, you can run the command using:

`wiki <TOPIC_NAME>`

Replace `<TOPIC_NAME>` with the actual topic you want to search for. The script will then fetch and display a summary of the topic from Wikipedia.

## .gitignore

To keep the repository clean, a `.gitignore` file has been added to exclude certain files and directories generated by the build process, such as `build/`, `dist/`, and `__pycache__/`. Ensure that you do not commit these to the repository.
